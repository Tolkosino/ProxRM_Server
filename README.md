ProxRM
Lightweight Remote VM Management for Proxmox

ProxRM is a minimalistic client/server application that allows you to remotely start virtual machines on your Proxmox host—no VPN required. Designed for HomeLab owners and small-scale setups, it provides a straightforward and lightweight solution for managing your VMs from anywhere with just a single open port.

✨ Features
Remote VM Control – Start your Proxmox VMs without being on the local network.
Minimal Setup – Built primarily with default Python modules, keeping dependencies low.
Tag-Based Permissions – Integrates with MySQL & LDAP for flexible access control (planned feature).
Web Interface – Simple HTML/PHP/JavaScript-based setup and user management.
Optimized for Small Deployments – Ideal for HomeLabs and small teams (1-5 users).


⚠ Note: Security is not the primary focus, as this project is not developed with deep security expertise. However, efforts are made to implement reasonable security measures where possible. Use at your own risk, especially in untrusted environments.
